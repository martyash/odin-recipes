        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Bananas</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Protein powder</li>
            <li>Kefir </li>
            <li>Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Steel cut oats (not quick oats)</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>add a small amount of water, a few ml to the blender bottle, this will prevent clumping in your drink</li>
            <li>add milk until you reach 100ml mark </li>
            <li>Add 1-2 scoops of protein powder and shake from the top of the bottle until the two current ingredients mix</li>
            <li>Break 1 banana into small pieces and add to bottle</li>
            <li>Break the second banana and add a spoonful of peanut butter to one of the pieces and add to the bottle </li>
            <li>Then add the rest of the pieces into the shake</li>
            <li>Add 100g of oats</li>
            <li>Add 50-100ml Kefir, try to add this onto the oats </li>
            <li>Add milk again, this is so the shake isn't too thick</li>
            <li>Add a few icecubes, i like to add about 5 or 6 </li>
            <li>Close the lid, shake it manually with your hand first to prevent clumping with the peanut butter</li>
            <li>After you notice it is somewhat mixed and is not clumped, you are ready to use the blender</li>
            <li>Do not rush the blender, mix up the speeds, sometimes go to 0 before turning it on again</li>
            <li>Pour into a glass and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
